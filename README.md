# ssnake_tutorials
This is a collection of NMR data processing tutorials for the ssNake software package (see
github.com/smeerten/ssnake). Every folder has a PDF as the tutorial, with the relevant NMR data as
separate files. The src directory holds the .tex files for the tutorial, and can be ignored.
